### Hey, my name is Paul Kim ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst looking for opportunities to apply my skills in the real world. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's in Data Science.

I really enjoy connecting with like-minded data people, and sharing my skills, experience, and personal journey. While AFK, I love to cook/try new foods, explore new places, solve puzzles, and relax in the sun.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my technical data skills (SQL, Python)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud computing with Microsoft Azure

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the new Avatar series on Netflix
